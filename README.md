# ShowsApp
Check tv series

# The challange

Develop in 5 days a app that consumes tvmaze api: https://www.tvmaze.com/api.
Tvmaze API is free and provides information about tv series.

The app should contain:
  * List of all shows
  * Show details
  * Season selection
  * Episode details
  * Search
  * Passcode

# The structure 

ShowApp uses MVVM-C as a pattern and delegates to bind views with his viewmodels.
To give the user a better navigability in such a large (infinity) list of shows ShowApp uses cache and prefetch data.

Three public available libraries were used to speed up development: 
  * SkeletonView - to animate loading views
  * SwiftKeychainWrapper - simple keychain wrapper to quickly store encrypted private data
  * KAPinField - to quickly desgin a pin text field

# The result

This v√≠deo demonstrates the final result:
